# Extended MumboJumbo V1 
MumboJumbo is an Experimental Algorithms for Sampling Linear-Space Individuals and Evaluation Fitness throw an Genetic Algorithm and Finding the Global Minima by minimizing the Fitness. This Algorithm is not Specifically Used for BBO (Black Box Optimization) Though This Evolution Could be Used During the Selection of the “Initial Bounding” 
# MumboJumbo.py
A minimal Prototype has been coded in Python3 and has been contained some benchmarking functions, Though Note that this Algorithms is a MumboJumbo :D 
# Results 
You can see the results and Review the code in a i-Notebook  that has been Published in following Adress.
